## Description
The program asks each user to provide a name of a bidder and an offered price. The number of players is unlimited and 
none of the bidders see each other's bid. Computer keeps a record of all bidders and offers made, then compares them 
and selects the biggest offer. The chosen one is the winner of the blind auction.

The program has been written in Replit with usage of their "clear()" function. I tried to move it to PyCharm and have 
found a replacement on StackOverflow to clean the console while running program, but it still does not work as intended, 
that will be fixed some day though.

This project was created for learning purposes.
